# Forecasting-with-approximate-dynamic-factor-models
Replication of the paper by Matteo Luciani (2014) 'Forecasting with approximate dynamic factor models: The role of non-pervasive shocks'. 

The research examines whether considering non-pervasive shocks improves forecasting accuracy in factor models. Traditional models focus on common shocks and assume weak cross-correlation in idiosyncratic components, possibly missing useful information when forecasting. To address this, this analysis introduces a model that applies shrinkage to the idiosyncratic part, making better use of non-pervasive shocks. Forecast accuracy is tested by comparing Mean Squared Errors (MSE) across various models, including AR(1), traditional factor models, and shrinkage-based methods. The analysis focuses on GDP, Inflation, and Residential Investment, with the latter expected to be most affected by non-pervasive shocks. The study also expands on the paperâ€™s methodology by implementing Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) as an additional forecasting approach.

The project was conducted in collaboration with Federico Bertoia, Nicola Cassarino and Benedikt Scheid.
